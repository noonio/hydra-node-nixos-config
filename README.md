# Another NixOS setup

A full NixOS-based image to run a Hydra Head with a group of peers.

It allows for:

- Deployment to GCP (by producing a GCE-compatible image; see <https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Install_NixOS_on_GCE> for steps to get the image onto GCP by uploading it to a bucket)
- Local-spin-up via qemu (for testing)
- A nixosConfiguration for re-building and redeploying via nixos-rebuild


### Redeploying

```shell
nixos-rebuild switch --target-host hydra@... --flake .#noon-hydra --use-remote-sudo
```


### Keys

Keys are expected to be generated/provided once it is spun up.

If you don't have keys already, you can generate them (one-off!) on the host
once it is up:

```shell
cd ~/cardano-data/credentials
genHydraKey
genCardanoKey
genFundsKey
```

The hydra-node service will


### Building an image for GCE

```shell
nix build .#gce
```

This gives a .raw.tar.gz file that can be:

- Uploaded to a bucket,
- Then used to make a new image on GCP,
- Which can then be used as a boot image

See "Create a VM instance" here: <https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Install_NixOS_on_GCE>


### Trivia

qemu invocation tips:

```shell
nix build .#qemu
cp result/nixos.qcow2 .
chmod 755 nixos.qcow2
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 8000 -drive file=nixos.qcow2,media=disk,if=virtio -nic user,model=virtio
```

Note that this results in very large nix store allocations; so if you do it
often don't forget to garbage-collect!
